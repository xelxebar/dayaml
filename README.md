## YAML Parser for Dyalog APL

Currently, this project in in the exploratory phase. We are using APL as a tool
to map out a different, parsimonious semantics for the YAML specification.
Consequently, the code is written in a specifically terse style that avoids
the overhead of affordances for newcomers.

If you are interested in this project, feel free to contact me directly. I am
happy to walk you through the code.
